# README

## Description
This project was created to enable a user to quickly generate a high quality readme following a series of prompts. Having a README file is an important part of a github repo, it gives users important information about the repo. Having an application that can generate this instantly, will speed up deployment and give engineers more time to focus on quality within the application.
